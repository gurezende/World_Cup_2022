# World_Cup_2022
Project modeling results of the matches in the FIFA World Cup 2022.


In this project, I have created two models:
* A model to predict the match result : home team wins, draw, home team loses.
* A model to predict the total goals in a match
* Some functions to give me the result and scores for each team.
